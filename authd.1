.SH NAME
authd \- keep kerberos and AFS credentials alive
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B authd

authd does not take any options

.SH DESCRIPTION
Kerberos and AFS credentials are only valid for a short period of time
(typically 10 hours), but are renewable for a longer period of time
(typically 8 days at CSAIL).  The authd program is a small daemon that
can be used to keep the credentials associated with a login session
alive for the duration of their renewable lifetime.  If new
credentials are obtained by hand, either before or after the
expiration of old credentials, authd will refresh them.

.SH "RETURN VALUE"
authd returns 0 upon successful exit, non-zero otherwise
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.B
\f. KRB5CCNAME
\-- path to Kerberos credential cache
.B
\f. PATH
\-- authd expects to find kinit and aklog in your PATH
.SH NOTES
authd is run by default in CSAIL ssh sessions
.PP
authd uses the value returned by
.BR getsid (2)
to determine which session it's associated with, and takes steps to
ensure that only one authd instance runs in that session.
Additionally, it monitors the session leader process and exits if it
determines that the original process no longer exists.
.SH BUGS
There's no feedback given to the user about the state of their credentials.
